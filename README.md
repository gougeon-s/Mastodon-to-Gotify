# Mastodon to Gotify
This Programm fetches notifications from Mastodon and pushes them to a Gotify server.

## Usage
First, rename the file settings.py.sample to settings.py and set all the configurations inside it.
Second, run the first_run.py file (this has to be done only once.)
Thirdly, run main.py

It is advised to have it running as a service.
